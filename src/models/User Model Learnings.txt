1. pre method
- how it is running when save is called on user model
- if password is not modified, exit middleware
- else, hash the password and store it in instance variable ; and then exit
- bcryptjs is an async function
My observation: We call pre method when we wanna modify functionality of a particular mongodb functionality
2. Creating a methods key in our schema which holds another object with the field - isPasswordCorrect
- this will take in a function which compares our password with the instantiated password (original password saved)
- we use bcrypt coz the password is hashed

3. Access and refresh tokens thing
